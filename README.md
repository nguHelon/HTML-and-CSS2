# Second HTML and CSS project

This project showcases a design of a social media app. It really tests on responsiveness and positioning skills, I did my best to make it look good on all devices, But anyways, Was really challenging though, but atleast I used what I know to do it.

## This is my journey to becoming a fullstack web developer.
